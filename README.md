# OOPs
This repository demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++. 
 It includes examples of:

Classes and Objects

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)

Polymorphism (Compile-time and Runtime)

Constructor & Destructor

Function Overloading & Overriding

Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

These examples are written in clean, well-commented C++ code and are intended for learners looking to strengthen their understanding of OOP principles through practical coding.
